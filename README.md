# NeuroSmith Neural Architect (MVP)

**A deterministic, multimodal neural network design studio built with Google AI Studio.**

NeuroSmith transforms **simple canvas sketches**, **structured dropdown selections**, and **optional voice commands** into a clean, deterministic `MODEL_SPEC` and corresponding deep-learning code (PyTorch or TensorFlow).  
It is designed for rapid neural architecture prototyping — without hallucination, without randomness, and with an intuitive UI.

---

## 🎯 Features (MVP)
- **Canvas Sketch Input** – capture rough architecture structure  
- **Layer Stack Builder** – select layer types and hyperparameters  
- **Deterministic Mode** – ensures reproducible output (same input → same code)  
- **Voice Input (Optional)** – simple parameter refinements  
- **Generate Model Code Button** – produces template-based, stable code  
- **Output Panel** – shows placeholder text, shimmer animation, and generated code  
- **Metrics Placeholder** – (Params / FLOPs / Memory shown as "—")

> This is the MVP release — additional planned features such as advanced validation, SVG diagrams, FLOPs calculation, and ONNX/Colab export appear in the roadmap but are not implemented yet.

## 🚀 Run Locally

**Prerequisite:** Node.js 18+

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add your Gemini API key
Create or edit `.env.local`:
```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Launch development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 AI Studio Version

## 🛣️ Roadmap (Post-MVP)
- Architecture diagram generation (SVG)
- FLOPs / parameter / memory estimation
- Enhanced validation checks (shape tracing, illegal sequences)
- Expanded template gallery (ResNet, U-Net, Transformer)
- Colab export for instant training
- ONNX export pipeline
