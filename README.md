# NeuroSmith Neural Architect (MVP)

**A deterministic, multimodal neural network design studio built with Google AI Studio.**

NeuroSmith transforms **simple canvas sketches**, **structured dropdown selections**, and **optional voice commands** into a clean, deterministic `MODEL_SPEC` and corresponding deep-learning code (PyTorch or TensorFlow).  
It is designed for rapid neural architecture prototyping — without hallucination, without randomness, and with an intuitive UI.

# ⭐ Why NeuroSmith Matters  
In a world rapidly shifting toward *no-code* and *vibe-coding* AI systems, users can describe intentions and receive entire applications or architectures automatically.  
This unlocks creativity and speed — but it also introduces three major risks:

---

### ❗ 1. Non-Determinism  
The same prompt can yield different outputs, making debugging and reproducibility extremely difficult.

**NeuroSmith solves this with:**  
**Deterministic Mode** → same inputs always produce identical architectures and code.  
No randomness. No drift. No hidden state.

---

### ❗ 2. Hallucinated or Invalid Architectures  
LLMs can generate architectures that are syntactically valid but structurally broken:  
missing Flatten layers, incorrect tensor shapes, unsupported ops, etc.

**NeuroSmith solves this with:**  
A **bounded, template-driven compiler** that only emits safe, framework-valid components.  
Defaults (ReLU, Softmax) ensure stability even when unspecified.

---

### ❗ 3. Lack of Auditability  
If a vibe-coded model is wrong, the user has no way to fix the system.  
It remains a black box.

**NeuroSmith solves this with:**  
A transparent, patchable workflow:  
- Clear `MODEL_SPEC`  
- Visible validations  
- Deterministic templates  
- Users can file issues → each issue becomes a rule update  
- The system gets *safer* over time  

NeuroSmith isn't just an AI tool —  
It's a **governed, deterministic architecture compiler** for the no-code era.

## 📸 UI Preview

NeuroSmith’s MVP interface shows deterministic neural architecture generation across diagram, code, and metrics tabs.  
Here are examples from the working prototype:

## 🎯 Features (MVP)
- **Canvas Sketch Input** – capture rough architecture structure  
- **Layer Stack Builder** – select layer types and hyperparameters  
- **Deterministic Mode** – ensures reproducible output (same input → same code)  
- **Voice Input (Optional)** – simple parameter refinements  
- **Generate Model Code Button** – produces template-based, stable code  
- **Output Panel** – shows placeholder text, shimmer animation, and generated code  
- **Metrics Placeholder** – (Params / FLOPs / Memory shown as "—")

> This is the MVP release — additional planned features such as advanced validation, SVG diagrams, FLOPs calculation, and ONNX/Colab export appear in the roadmap but are not implemented yet.
